This is the code implementation for the ROCLING 2025 paper "Information-theoretic conditioning in terminological alternations in specialized domains: The cases of Taiwan Mandarin legal language and English biomedical language."

Due to dataset size, the datasets per se are not uploaded. Interested users could find the legal document dataset from the Governmet OpenData platform (http://data.gov.tw) and the biomedical dataset from the PMC Open Access Subset (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/openftlist/).
